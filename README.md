Helping you pick the best premiership fantasy football team

Our wonderful group consists of:

to get it working, scrape players and gameweek totals in the scrape files folder (i.e. python "players.y" and python player_gameweek_data.py") and then update players projected points by running the rake file for projected points (i.e. run rake projection:update_projections)
